# **Milestone Status Report**



## **What we have accomplished:** 

We have read related websites and papers, learnt about detailed theories of Monte-Carlo ray tracing algorithm and realized the framework of code(with some bugs).



## **Reflection on progress relative to our initial plan:**

At the beginning, we didn't have a clear division of labor, so we wasted a lot of time having worthless communication and worked inefficiently. Fortunately, we found out the problem and discovered a way to solve it after discussion.



## **Our future plan:**

Continue debugging and test the code/see how it works.

Discuss the ways to optimize the results and implement some optimizations. 

Draw a conclusion of our work and prepare for the presentation.
